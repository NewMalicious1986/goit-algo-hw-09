## Conclusions

### Greedy Algorithm
- **Pros:**
  - Simple and fast.
  - Highly efficient for canonical coin systems (e.g., `[50, 25, 10, 5, 2, 1]`).
- **Cons:**
  - May not yield an optimal solution for non-standard coin sets.

### Dynamic Programming Approach
- **Pros:**
  - Always produces the optimal solution regardless of the coin system.
- **Cons:**
  - Can be computationally expensive (both in time and space) for very large amounts.

### Final Conclusion
For a cash register system using a canonical coin set like `[50, 25, 10, 5, 2, 1]`, the **greedy algorithm** is preferred due to its simplicity and superior performance. However, if the system must handle non-standard coin sets where the greedy method might fail, the **dynamic programming approach** guarantees correctness, albeit with increased computational overhead.
